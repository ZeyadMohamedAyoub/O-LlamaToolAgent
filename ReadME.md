# Case Study:

## Introduction

In this project, I set out to build a simple,but powerful agent that leverages a local LLM (Llama3.2) to answer questions with the ability to use external tools when needed. This case study walks through my approach, the challenges I faced, how I managed to solve them.

## My Goal

My goal was to avoid the "hallucination" problem, where the model predicts answers instead of relying on real data.

### The Problem: Hallucinated

When you ask a language model a question like "What's the weather in Cairo? ", it will confidently answer even if it has no real data to rely on!
I wanted my agent to STOP before making up an answer and call a real functinon like `get_weather`, and then continue the convo with the actual result.

---

### My Approach

#### 1. The "Before Stop" Pipeline

At first, i let the model generate the entire answer in one go, For example:

`Question: What is the weather like in Cairo? Thought: I want to get the current weather information for Cairo. Action: { "action": "get_weather", "action_input": {"location": "Cairo"} } Observation: The current weather in Cairo is mostly sunny with a temperature of 25¬∞C (77¬∞F) and a gentle breeze. Final Thought: I now have the current weather information for Cairo. Final Answer: The current weather in Cairo is mostly sunny with a temperature of 25¬∞C (77¬∞F).`

**NOTICE:** THE model just made up the weather! and wow what a convincing and confident way he's talking üêÇ! this is a classic hallucination no real API call was made.

#### 2. The "After Stop" Pipeline

To fix this, I used the `stop` parameter in Ollama's API to halt generation at `"Observation:"`. This way the model outputs everything up to the point where it needs real data, like so:

`Question: What is the weather like in Cairo?   Thought: I need to get current information about Cairo's weather.  Action: { "action": "get_weather", "action_input": {"location": "Cairo"} }   Observation:` STOP

**NOTICE**: Now the model stops and waits for the actual observation. And this is my chance to inject the real result from a function or API.

#### 3. The Final Pipeline: Code-in-the-LOop?

With the model stopped, I call my own `get_weather` function, get the real weather and then **continue the conversation** by feeding the observation and the previous context back into the model (without the stop condition).

This results in an accurate answer:

`Question: What is the weather like in Cairo?`
`Thought: I want to get the current weather in Cairo.`
`Action:`
`{`
`"action": "get_weather",`
`"action_input": {"location": "Cairo"}`
`}`
`Observation: The current weather in Cairo is sunny with a temperature of 37¬∞C.`

`Final Thought: I have confirmed the current weather in Cairo.`
`Final Answer: The current weather in Cairo is sunny with a temperature of 37¬∞C.`

## key Takeaways

- **Stopping at the right time** is crucial to prevent hallucinations and enable real tool use.
- **Human-in-the-loop orchestration** (or code-in-the-loop!) lets us combine LLM reasoning with actual data sources.
- This pattern is the foundation for building reliable, tool-using AI agents.

## Why?

LLMs are powerful, but they sometimes make things up. This project shows how I built a local LLM agent that _knows when to shut up_, call real tools, and then respond with accurate data, thus making it a step closer to a reliable AI assistant.
